# Blissversate
ActivityPub-federated commenting system that'll possibly be based on Commento (or maybe Isso? not sure what I'll fork yet) so I don't have to start from scratch. Repo exists just so I don't forget the idea for now.

My goal is to have it be a usable alternative to Disqus (including real-time discussion stuff like "x new comments below/above" and "x replies" when a comment with replies is in view) without all the weird ads and bugs, and with improved privacy.

Other planned features include the option to hide or show downvote counts (like my no-downvote-display extension), hide or show upvote counts, theme choices, some fun commands that do things based on the users in a discussion and other stuff like that (idea from a certain Disqus enhancer extension). Commands can be turned off by the instance, and themes and upvote/downvote counts can by set with defaults by the instance and changed by the user. Of course, blocking and muting profiles like Twitter will be available, where both shows a button to show the comment (if possible in ActivityPub), blocking prevents the profile from seeing your profile, and muting just hides their stuff. Word or phrase filters for muting to hide comments will be available too. Obviously instance blocking will be available for both profiles and instances. There should also be an option for users to hide the "x user(s) are/is typing" and "x comments above/below" to make it less addicting.
