# Blissversate
ActivityPub-federated commenting system that'll possibly be based on Commento (or maybe Isso? not sure what I'll fork yet) so I don't have to start from scratch. Repo exists just so I don't forget the idea for now.

My goal is to have it be a usable alternative to Disqus (including real-time discussion stuff like "x new comments below/above" and "x replies" when a comment with replies is in view) without all the weird ads and bugs, and with improved privacy.
